# LinearDiscriminantAnalysys
differentiate between genuine and counterfeit money.
Suppose you are the manager of a bank and you have the problem of discriminating between genuine and counterfeit banknotes. You are measuring several distances on the banknote and the width and height of it.

Measuring these values of about 100 genuine and 100 counterfeit banknotes, Use the data set to set up a model which is based on linear discriminant analysis and is capable of discriminating between genuine and counterfeit money classification. (Import banknotes.csv)

Check the accuracy of your model using confusion matrix.
